# Blockchain-Stuff
Contains all things I've done related to web3, blockchain, smart contracts, etc. See folder descriptions for more details. 

Some folder descriptions: 
 >  1. Web3-Basic-Storage: Utilizes web3 to make a state change to a simple smart contract and then deploys it on a local blockchain (ganache CLI) or Rinkeby test net.

 > 2. Brownie-Basic-Storage: Uses the brownie framework to make a state change to a simple smart contract and then deploys it on a local blockchain (ganache CLI) or Rinkeby test net (does the same thing as Web3-Basic-Storage but is simpler thanks to brownie with the addition of testing capabilities and a contracter reader).
